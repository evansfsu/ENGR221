Class MySet:
    Constructor (__init__()):
        Input: A list of the initial values in the set
        Required attributes:
            __s: Values in the set (list)
            __size: Number of values in the set (int)
        Implementation:
            Initialize __s as an empty list
            Initialize __size to 0
            Iterate through the input list:
                If the value is not already in __s, add it to __s and increment __size

    search():
        Input: A value to search for within the set
        Output: A Boolean indicating whether the value is in the set
        Implementation:
            Iterate through __s:
                If the value is found, return True
            If the value is not found after iterating through all elements, return False

    insert():
        Input: A value to be added to the set
        Output: None
        Implementation:
            Check if the value already exists in __s using search():
                If the value is not found, append it to __s and increment __size

    delete():
        Input: A value to delete from the set
        Output: A Boolean indicating whether the value was deleted from the set
        Implementation:
            Iterate through __s:
                If the value is found, remove it from __s and decrement __size, then return True
            If the value is not found after iterating through all elements, return False

    traverse():
        Input: None
        Output: A printed list of all the items in the set
        Implementation:
            Iterate through __s and print each element
